# StudyPal
Hi Jason!

### Whats been done so far
* App compiles with a working UI that has a few secondary buttons and allows you to click between the 4 main tabs. Fire it up and take a look!
* Serverside API currently handles the scrapping of the UVM Schedule of Courses. Server is run on swift, and the API can by used over HTTP requests with a query. Returns JSON file of what matches the query. Try it out:
https://one.ehinchli.w3.uvm.edu/api/courses/search/?query=mobile
* A basic example of how Swift will call the API has been built, but it features no processing yet.
(UVM-StudyPal/APICalls.swift)
* While they are not functionally implemented into the app yet, a set of Parent/Child classes covering Courses, Study Blocks, and Custom events has been written and now just needs to be expanded to work with the API and UI.
(UVM-StudyPal/CalendarItems.swift, CourseItems.swift, StudyItems.swift, CustomItems.swift)
